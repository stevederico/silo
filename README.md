# silo

silo is a privacy-first application that allows you to chat with Large Language Models (LLMs) locally on your device. It ensures 
absolute privacy and security by keeping all data processing local without any tracking or monitoring. [Available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/silo-private-ai-assistant/id6741248135)

## Features
- **LLM Chat**: Works with Open-Source LLM models like Llama, Mistral, Smol, Phi, and even custom GGUF models from Hugging Face.
- **Secure**: Chat with LLM models locally, ensuring no data leaves your device. Your messages are private and cannot be seen by anyone, including us.
- **Offline**: Use Silo anytime, anywhere without an internet connection. All information stays on your device; no data is sent to the cloud.
- **Anonymous**: No login or personal information required. There is no usage statistics or tracking, ensuring absolute anonymity.
- **Fast**: Provides quick answers through local processing for rapid query responses.
